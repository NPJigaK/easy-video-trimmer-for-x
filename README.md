# Easy Video Trimmer for X.com

[日本人向けREADME](README_JP.md)

Easy Video Trimmer for X.com is a Chrome extension aimed at bringing back the simple video trimming experience previously available on Twitter's official site.  
All video processing still happens entirely offline within your browser: trimming / demuxing / muxing are handled by ffmpeg.wasm, while H.264 video encoding now prefers WebCodecs so Chrome can use hardware acceleration when available (automatically falling back to CPU-only ffmpeg.wasm when not).  
No longer do you have to open external video editing software every time; you can easily trim and post gameplay highlights or other videos directly within X.com's posting interface.

## version

1.0.0-alpha.1

### Why Alpha Version?

This extension relies entirely on ffmpeg.wasm for video processing, which is currently subject to performance and technical limitations imposed by browsers (WebAssembly and Chromium).  
Therefore, we consider it an **Alpha Version (experimental)** until the following major issues are resolved:

- https://github.com/NPJigaK/easy-video-trimmer-for-x/issues/5
  - ~~Due to technical constraints in WebAssembly, ffmpeg.wasm cannot utilize GPU hardware encoding, resulting in speeds **about 1/10 that of native (installed) software**. The new WebCodecs path mitigates this on browsers that support hardware encode, but environments without WebCodecs still fall back to CPU-only ffmpeg.wasm.~~
  - fixed: https://github.com/NPJigaK/easy-video-trimmer-for-x/pull/10

- https://github.com/NPJigaK/easy-video-trimmer-for-x/issues/6
  - Chromium-based browsers currently limit stable parallel processing (thread count) of ffmpeg.wasm to a maximum of **4 threads**. Specifying 5 or more threads causes processing to hang. We're waiting for fixes from Chromium / ffmpeg.wasm developers.

- https://github.com/NPJigaK/easy-video-trimmer-for-x/issues/7
  - Currently, videos cannot be automatically attached to the X.com posting form. Due to Chromium's security restrictions, browser extensions (content scripts) have limited access to webpage DOM. Additionally, X.com's strict security policy (CSP) restricts this further. We are researching possible solutions for automatic attachment.

## ⚙️ Video Specifications

In compliance with [official best practices](https://developer.x.com/ja/docs/media/upload-media/uploading-media/media-best-practices):

| Item            | Specification                |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Minimum length  | 5 seconds                    |
| Maximum length  | 139 seconds                  |
| Video codec     | H.264 (`libx264`, High @ 4.1)|
| Audio codec     | AAC 128 kbps                 |
| Resolution      | Up to 720p                   |
| Thread count    | 4 (WASM)                     |

### WebCodecs acceleration (new)

- H.264 encoding prefers WebCodecs (hardware accelerated by Chrome when available).
- ffmpeg.wasm is still used for trimming, AAC audio, and MP4 mux/remux.
- If WebCodecs is unavailable or fails, the pipeline automatically falls back to CPU-only ffmpeg.wasm.
